Projects:

jsphjia/real-estate-predictor: (currently working on)
  This project focuses on creating a machine learning model to predict potential final sale prices of houses on the market or in the future uses statistics of nearby houses of similar size. 
  I take into consideration data about square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, and sale history to make predictions that can be found on mainstream websites like Zillow and Redfin.

jsphjia/combat-robotics: (currently working on)
  This project focuses on creating a computer vision model to detect the house robot in NHRL combat robot competitions. 
  This is part of the development of a fully autonomous battle bot that will use autonomous path planning and computer vision to compete.
  This model for the house robot will be used in order for our robot to not attack it and mistake it as the opposing robot.

jsphjia/code-store:
  This project has code from my computer programming courses at Carnegie Mellon University.
